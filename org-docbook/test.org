* Introduction

This is a text file written in Org-mode ([[http://www.orgmode.org]]), and it
is used as a test case for my Org-to-DocBook exporter.  Each section
contains some feature in Org-mode...

* About Sections and Subsections

DocBook supports numbered sections and also /recursive/ sections.  We
choose recursive sections (element =<section>=) in DocBook exporter to
make generated DocBook documents much more portable.  Sections can be
freely moved to different places, either in an article or in a book, at
different levels.

As Org files tend to contain a lot of headings, which are transformed to
/empty/ sections in DocBook.  Empty paragraphs, like =<para></para>=,
are added for such sections to make generated XML document valid.

** Subsection x.1

*** Empty Subsection x.1.1
*** Subsection x.1.2

** Subsection x.2

*** Subsection x.2.1

**** Subsection x.2.1.1
***** Subsection x.2.1.1.1
****** Subsection x.2.1.1.1.1

** Subsection x.3

* About Images

Here is an image with caption and label:

#+CAPTION: Caption of image GNU.png
#+LABEL:   fig:gnu-png
[[~/Org/GNU.png]]

In Org-mode, an image file can be used as the description of a link, and
the image is exported as a click-able image in HTML export.  In DocBook
format, the image file path is formatted as it is.  See the following
link: [[file:///Users/bcui/Downloads/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html][file:/Users/bcui/Org/docbook-cover.png]]

* About Timestamps, TODOs, and Tags

This is a timestamp <2009-03-02 Mon>. 

For TODOs, we can simply put the TODO keywords in =[...]= to make them
stand out in section titles.  For tags, they are formatted as
superscript.  We may need to find other better-looking formats.

** TODO My First Item.                                          :work:urgent:

** DONE My Second Item.

** TODO My Third Item.                                            :home:_old:

* About Footnotes

Please see my first footnote. [fn:1]  And here is the second one. [fn:2]

Check the first footnote again. [fn:1]

Here is a long footnote. [fn:three]

This is a LaTeX-like anonymous footnote. [fn:: This is the inline
\par definition of this anonymous footnote.]

This is another footnote with inline definition /and/ a
name.  [fn:name-1: This is the definition of second inline footnote,
\par which has a name.]

Here I am referring to the previous named footnote. [fn:name-1]

* About Tables

This is a simple table:

| First Name | Last Name |   Tele # |
|------------+-----------+----------|
| Baoqiu     | Cui       | 123-4567 |
| David      | Smith     | 999-9999 |
| John       | Dean      | 888-8888 |
|------------+-----------+----------|
| Scott      | Fisher    | 111-1111 |

* About Verses and Quotes

If the source of a verse or quote (a.k.a. /attribution/ in DocBook) is
found in the verse or quote, an =<attribution>= element will be added to
element =<blockquote>=.  This helps format verses or quotes more nicely.

** Verses

The following is a verse with attribution ("=-- AlexSchroeder=", which
appears in the /last/ line in the verse):

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Great clouds overhead
Tiny black birds rise and fall
Snow covers Emacs

-- AlexSchroeder
#+END_VERSE

The next one is a verse /without/ attribution:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
O, for a muse of fire, that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention!
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
#+END_VERSE

** Block Quotes

This is a block quote with attribution ("=-- Albert Einstein=", which
appears in the /last/ line of the quote).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler.  -- Albert Einstein
#+END_QUOTE

Here is one block quote that has two paragraphs but no attribution:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates
empirically.

Great spirits have always found violent opposition from
mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not
thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and
courageously uses his intelligence.
#+END_QUOTE

* About Literal Examples

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to
markup.  Such examples will be typeset in monospace, so this is well
suited for source code and similar examples.  

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Some example from a text file.  This can include characters like '<'
    and '>', etc.
    
    The following line should not be regarded as the continuation of a long
    footnote: 
\par This is NOT part of a footnote.
#+END_EXAMPLE

For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start the
example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be
additional whitespace before the colon:

Here is an example:
:     #include <iostream>
:     #include <iterator>
:     using namespace std;
:     
:     int main(int ac, char* av[])
:     {
:         try {
:           ...
:         }
:         catch(exception& e) {
:             cerr << "error: " << e.what() << "\n";
:             return 1;
:         }
:         catch(...) {
:             cerr << "Exception of unknown type!\n";
:         }
:     
:         return 0;
:     }

* About Drawers

   Still outside the drawer.
   :PROPERTIES:

text, and ~verbatim~ text.

* Random Pieces

** Lord of the Rings

        My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
            - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
        Important actors in this film are:
        - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
        - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in the Goonies.

[fn:1] Body of first footnote.
[fn:2] Body of second footnote.
[fn:three] This is the body of the third footnote, and it is long,
\par and it is long, and it is long, and it is long, and it is long,
\par and it is long, and it is long, and it is long, and it is long,
\par and it is long, and it is long, and it is long.... Stop here!

* About Code Reference Labels

The following is a two-line program listing.  Since options "=-n -r="
are specified, we display the line numbers but remove the code reference
labels.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion                  (ref:sc)
   (goto-char (point-min))       (ref:jump)
#+END_SRC
In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current positon.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
jumps to point-min.

The following listing continues from the previous one (option "=+n=" is
specified).  Since option "=-r=" does not exist, code reference labels
are /not/ removed:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp +n
(defgroup org-export-docbook nil
  "Options for exporting Org-mode files to DocBook."  (ref:doc)
  :tag "Org Export DocBook"                           (ref:tag)
  :group 'org-export)
#+END_SRC

Line [[(doc)]] is the group documentation, and line [[(tag)]] is the group tag.
