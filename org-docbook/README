This directory contains the (old version of) DocBook exporter for
Org-mode (http://orgmode.org).  As of March 29, 2009, this exporter has
been integrated into Org-mode git repository by Carsten Dominik (Thanks,
Carsten!), and will be part of next Org-mode release (6.25).

Future development of DocBook exporter will be done in Org-mode git
repository, and will not be continued here.

Below is the old content of this README file.

This is the DocBook exporter for Org-mode, a tool written in Emacs Lisp
to export text files written in Org-mode to DocBook format.  You need to
download the latest development version of Org-mode from
http://orgmode.org/ in order to use this exporter.  (Many thanks to
Carsten for making the changes in org-exp.el to support this DocBook
exporter back-end!)
