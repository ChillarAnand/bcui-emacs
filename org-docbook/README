This is the DocBook exporter for Org-mode, a tool written in Emacs Lisp
to export text files written in Org-mode to DocBook format.  You need to
download the latest development version of Org-mode from
http://orgmode.org/ in order to use this exporter.  (Many thanks to
Carsten for making the changes in org-exp.el to support this DocBook
exporter back-end!)

This directory contains:
